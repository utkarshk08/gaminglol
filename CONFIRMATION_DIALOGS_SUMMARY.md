# GameStore Confirmation Dialogs & Game Images - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Confirmation Dialogs Added**
**Problem**: Users could accidentally spend money without confirmation for wallet additions, subscriptions, and game purchases.

**Solution**: Added confirmation dialogs for all financial transactions.

#### **Wallet Addition Confirmation**
- **Trigger**: When user clicks "Add to Wallet" button
- **Message**: `"Are you sure you want to add $X to your wallet?"`
- **Action**: User must confirm before money is added

#### **Subscription Confirmation**
- **Trigger**: When user clicks any subscription plan (Basic, Premium, Ultimate)
- **Message**: `"Are you sure you want to subscribe to the [PLAN] plan for $X.XX/month?"`
- **Action**: User must confirm before subscription is created and money is deducted

#### **Game Purchase Confirmation**
- **Trigger**: When user clicks "Buy" button on any game
- **Message**: `"Are you sure you want to purchase "[GAME TITLE]" for $X.XX?"` (or "for Free" for free games)
- **Action**: User must confirm before game is purchased and money is deducted

### 2. **Game Images Fixed**
**Problem**: Game images were not updating after the code changes.

**Root Cause**: 
- Git rebase conflict caused temporary file loss
- Database still contained old placeholder images
- Application needed restart to reinitialize with new images

**Solution**:
- Resolved git conflicts and restored all files
- Cleared game database to force reinitialization
- Restarted application to load new Steam game cover images
