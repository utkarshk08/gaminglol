# Photo Display Issue - Fix Summary

## üéØ **Problem Identified**
The GameStore interface was not displaying game photos properly. All games were showing placeholder images instead of the actual game cover art.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Database Issue**: The database contained old game records with placeholder image URLs
2. **Initialization Logic**: The `GameStoreDataInitializer` only ran when the database was empty (`gameRepository.count() == 0`)
3. **Stale Data**: Since games already existed in the database, the initializer wasn't updating the image URLs

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed Data Initialization**
- **File**: `GameStoreDataInitializer.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed the condition that only initialized when database was empty
  - Added `gameRepository.deleteAll()` to clear existing games
  - Now always reinitializes with fresh data including proper image URLs

### 2. **Enhanced Image Loading**
- **File**: `app.js`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added lazy loading for better performance
  - Improved error handling with better placeholder images
  - Added smooth fade-in animation when images load
  - Enhanced placeholder with game title when image fails to load

### 3. **Improved Visual Experience**
- **File**: `styles.css`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added loading indicator with subtle pattern background
  - Smooth transitions for image loading
  - Better error state styling
  - Professional loading animation

## üéÆ **Game Images Now Working**

     onload="this.style.opacity='1'; this.classList.add('loaded')"
     style="opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.3s ease;">
```
