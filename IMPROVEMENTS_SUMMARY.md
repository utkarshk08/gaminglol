# GameStore Improvements Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Game Images Added
**Problem**: Games were showing placeholder images instead of real game covers.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `GameStoreDataInitializer.java` to use real Steam game cover images
- Added high-quality game covers for all 20 games using Steam's CDN
- Images are now properly displayed in the game store

**Games with Real Images**:
- Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, GTA V, Minecraft, Among Us
- Fall Guys, Valorant, League of Legends, Counter-Strike 2
- Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring, Hogwarts Legacy, Call of Duty MW3
- FIFA 24, NBA 2K24, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Spider-Man 2
- God of War RagnarÃ¶k, Horizon Forbidden West, The Last of Us Part II

### 2. Subscription Display Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Money was being deducted for subscriptions but the UI showed "No active subscription".

**Root Cause**: Frontend was checking for `userSubscription.isActive` but the JSON serialization might return the field as `active` instead of `isActive`.

**Solution**:
- Updated frontend logic to check for both `isActive` and `active` fields
- Added debugging logs to track subscription responses
- Enhanced error handling for subscription operations
- Added beautiful styling for active subscription display

**Technical Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
if (userSubscription && userSubscription.isActive) {

// After  
const isActive = userSubscription && (userSubscription.isActive || userSubscription.active);
if (userSubscription && isActive) {
```
